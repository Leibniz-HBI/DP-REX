* For the frontend run `npm install` from  the `ui` directory.


## Preparing the backend
The following steps are required for the initial setup.
You only need to run them once.
* Create an instance of the environment file by running `cp .template.env .env`
* Generate a secret key using `< /dev/urandom tr -dc _A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c${1:-64};echo`;.
* Copy the secret key and paste it as the value of the variable `DJANGO_KEY` in the `.env` file.
* Set the variable `VRAN_DEBUG` to true in the `.env` file.
* Generate a local database by runing `poetry run ./manage.py migrate`.
## Running
* Start the backend by running `poetry run ./manage.py  runserver`.
* In a seperate shell switch to the `ui` directory and run `npm start`.
